\title{Example2: the score summary statistics and their variance for continuous traits}
\format{
A list with 3 sublists:
\describe{
\item{sumstats}{a list of score summary statistics for all the SNPs in the gene for each trait in each environmental group}
\item{common.sumstats}{a list of score summary statistics for a large number of independent common variants for each trait in each environmental group}
\item{MAF}{a vector of minor allele frequency for each SNP in the gene.}
\item{R.C}{a SNP correlation matrix for all the SNPs in the gene}
\item{KA}{a \eqn{K \times K} matrix of genetic correlation matrix for \eqn{K} traits}}
}
\usage{
sumstats.dat
}
\description{
